## What Clip Paste Does

### Default Finder behavior
When you try to paste something that is **not** a file or a folder in Finder, nothing happens.

### With Clip Paste
When the app detects **text or an image** in the clipboard and you paste into Finder, it automatically creates:

- an image file, or  
- a text file  

directly in the folder where you attempted to paste.

## Customization

You can configure Clip Paste to match your workflow:

- Enable or disable image and text file creation
- Customize filename templates
- Choose a default save location when the shortcut is triggered outside Finder
- Choose which keyboard shortcut activates the action
